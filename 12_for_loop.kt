fun main(){
//    Kotlin For Loop
//    Often when you work with arrays, you need to loop through all of the elements.
//
//    To loop through array elements, use the for loop together with the in operator:
    val cars = arrayOf("Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda")
    for (x in cars) {
        println(x)
    }
