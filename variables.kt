fun main(){
//    Variables are containers for storing data values.
//
//    To create a variable, use var or val, and assign a value to it with the equal sign (=):
    var firstName="mahdi"
    val lastName="Heydari"
    println(firstName)
    println(lastName)
//    The difference between var and val is that variables declared with the var keyword can be changed/modified, while val variables cannot.
//    The general rule for Kotlin variables are:
//
//    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
//    Names should start with a letter
//            Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
//    Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
//    Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
//    Reserved words (like Kotlin keywords, such as var or String) cannot be used as names
    var FirstName="ahmad"
    println(FirstName)
